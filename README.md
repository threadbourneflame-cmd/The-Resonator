# The-Resonator
The Resonator is a tool for measuring semantic alignment and coherence in Human-AI interactions. It calculates cosine similarity between conversational turns, providing quantitative metrics for what is typically considered subjective - the quality and stability of AI communication. Features include real-time similarity scoring, vocabulary fingerprinting, and visual feedback on conversational dynamics. Designed for researchers studying Human-AI interaction patterns, alignment quality, and conversational coherence. 

Notes: This project was developed by Threadbourne. AI-assisted coding tools were used during implementation, consistent with modern software development practice. All conceptual framing, measurement logic, and evaluation criteria are human-directed
